@brief Needleman-Wunsch reconstruction implementation.

If the score is provided function uses Ukkonen's banded optimization. Function
also utilizes Hirschberg's algorithm and therefore is linear in memory. 
QueryFrontGap and targetFrontGap arguments can't both be not equal to 0. 
QueryBackGap and targetBackGap arguments can't both be not equal to 0. 
For path format see ::Alignment.
If needed function utilzes provided CUDA cards.

@param path output path
@param pathLen output path length
@param outScore output score
@param query query chain
@param queryFrontGap if not equal to 0, force that path starts in #MOVE_UP
@param queryBackGap if not equal to 0, force that path ends in #MOVE_UP
@param target target chain
@param targetFrontGap if not equal to 0, force that path starts in #MOVE_LEFT 
@param targetBackGap if not equal to 0, force that path ends in #MOVE_LEFT 
@param scorer scorer object used for alignment
@param score input alignment score if known, otherwise #NO_SCORE 
@param cards cuda cards index array
@param cardsLen cuda cards index array length
@param thread thread on which the function will be executed, if NULL function is
    executed on the current thread
