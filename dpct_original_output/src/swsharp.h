Simple library usage can be seen in the following simple.c file. This short 
program aligns two nucleotide sequences in fasta format. The nucleotides paths 
are read from the command line as the first two arguments. This example is for 
the linux platform.

simple.c:

\code{.c}
#include "swsharp/swsharp.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

    Chain* query = NULL;
    Chain* target = NULL; 
    
    // read the query as the first command line argument
    readFastaChain(&query, argv[1]);
    
    // read the target as the first command line argument
    readFastaChain(&target, argv[2]);
    
    // use one CUDA card with index 0
    int cards[] = { 0 };
    int cardsLen = 1;
    
    // create a scorer object
    // match = 1
    // mismatch = -3
    // gap open = 5
    // gap extend = 2
    Scorer* scorer;
    scorerCreateScalar(&scorer, 1, -3, 5, 2);

    // do the pairwise alignment, use Smith-Waterman algorithm
    Alignment* alignment;
    alignPair(&alignment, SW_ALIGN, query, target, scorer, cards, cardsLen, NULL);
     
    // output the results in emboss stat-pair format
    outputAlignment(alignment, NULL, SW_OUT_STAT_PAIR);
    
    // clean the memory
    alignmentDelete(alignment);

    chainDelete(query);
    chainDelete(target);
    
    scorerDelete(scorer);
    
    return 0;
}
\endcode

This code can be compiled with:

\code
nvcc simple.c -I include/ -L lib/ -l swsharp -l pthread -o simple
\endcode

And the executable can be run with:

\code
./simple input1.fasta input2.fasta
\endcode
