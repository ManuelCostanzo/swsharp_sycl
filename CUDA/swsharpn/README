Swsharpn is a CUDA-GPU based tool for performing Smith-Waterman alignment on 
nucleotides.

usage: swsharpn -i <query file> -j <target file> [arguments ...]

arguments:
    -i, --query <file>
        (required)
        input fasta query file
    -j, --target <file>
        (required)
        input fasta target file
    -g, --gap-open <int>
        default: 5
        gap opening penalty, must be given as a positive integer 
    -e, --gap-extend <int>
        default: 2
        gap extension penalty, must be given as a positive integer
    --match <int>
        default: 1
        match score, must be given as a positive integer
    --mismatch <int>
        default: -3
        mismatch penalty, must be given as a negative integer
    --cards <ints>
        default: all available CUDA cards
        list of cards should be given as an array of card indexes delimited with
        nothing, for example usage of first two cards is given as --cards 01
    --score
        if given only the score without the alignment is outputed, also
        --outfmt option is ignored
    --out <string>
        default: stdout
        output file for the alignment
    --outfmt <string>
        default: pair-stat
        out format for the output file, must be one of the following: 
            pair      - emboss pair output format 
            pair-stat - combination of pair and stat output
            plot      - output used for plotting alignment with gnuplot 
            stat      - statistics of the alignment
            dump      - binary format for usage with swsharpout
    -h, -help
        prints out the help
